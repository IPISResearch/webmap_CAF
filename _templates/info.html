<h1>Interactive webmap of the Central African Republic</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The present map is an interactive webmap of the Central African Republic. It provides a visual
representation of incidents, natural resources, armed actor areas of influence and other relevant
dynamics relating to conflict and crisis in the Central African Republic.

<h2>How to use this map</h2>
In the legend on the right, you can select the datasets that you wish to render visible on the map. Within many layers,
you can also filter for specific types of features using the filter options.
<br><br>
For many of the points, lines or polygons on the map, a pop-up window with additional information appears when
clicking on them.
<br><br>
When clicking on incidents, this popup will appear in a popup pane to the right of the screen placing that
incident in a timeline of events nationally. Note that many major or strategically important locations can
contain multiple incident entries. These entries will appear in a chronological spiral with the most recent
at the center, when the location is clicked on.
<br><br>
A histogram at the bottom of the page enables the user to get an overview of the severity of the conflict over time.
This histogram also features a time slider, which allows to filter the incidents to only those within the selected period.

Given the difficulty of gathering precise geographic data and the poor quality of the information available, the maps inevitably contain inaccuracies and are not comprehensive.
Therefore, all of the maps are to be considered indicative and limited, rather than an exact representation of the geographic features presented.
A similar caveat applies to the summary statistics of the violent incidents presented in the legend of the map. The incidents shown cannot be considered to be exhaustive and are not necessarily suited for statistical analysis. IPIS welcomes any feedback or corrections at <a href="mailto:mapping@ipisresearch.be">mapping@ipisresearch.be</a>.
