For many of the icons or areas on the map, a pop-up window with additional information appears when
clicking on them.

When clicking on incidents, this popup will appear in a popup pane to the right of the screen placing that
incident in a timeline of events nationally. Note that many major or strategically important locations can
contain multiple incident entries. These entries will appear in a chronological spiral with the most recent
at the center, when the location is clicked on.

A histogram at the bottom of the page enables the user to render incidents between specific periods
only visible.
