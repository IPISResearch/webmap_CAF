<h1>Interactive webmap of the Central African Republic</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The present map is an interactive webmap of the Central African Republic, and accompanies a <a href="https://ipisresearch.be/publication/central-african-republic-conflict-mapping/">report</a> published in September 2018. The map provides a visual representation of incidents, natural resources, armed actor areas of influence and other relevant dynamics relating to conflict and crisis in the Central African Republic.

<h2>How to use this map</h2>
In the legend on the right, you can select the data set that you wish to make visible on the map. You can also create your own custom maps by switching layers in the legend on or off to overlay them. Within many layers, you can also switch certain elements comprising that data layer on or off. In this way, you can for example filter by actor or incident, mine or roadblock type, etc. 
<br><br>
For many of the icons or areas on the map, a pop-up window with additional information appears when you click on the icon. If you click on an incident a popup will appear to the right of the screen. This popup appears as part of an incident timeline that places the incident within the context of other such events that have occurred in the country. Many major towns or strategically important locations often have multiple (up to 20 or 30) incident entries. If you click on these locations, all the incident entries will appear in a chronological spiral with the most recent at the center.
<br><br>
Time frames visible can be adjusted using the green bar at the bottom of the histogram. The histogram and legend can be collapsed by clicking on the small cross in the top right. You can search for places using the search function and zoom in or out to see certain areas in more detail.

For the geographic base data (territorial boundaries, places, points of interest, building outlines, relief, roads and rivers) IPIS has made use of GIS data from Open Street Map (OSM), the University of Bangui (LACCEG), the World Resources Institute (WRI), the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Central Africa Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE), and the Humanitarian and Development Partnership Team (HDPT) CAR.

Additional sources used for specific layers are as listed here:
<ul>
	<li>The incidents layer is based predominantly on reporting available through open source platforms, including ACLED, UN agencies, the LRA Crisis Tracker and press releases.</li>
	<li>The layer on armed groups shows approximate areas of control and influence in December 2017. It has been compiled with data from the UN Panel of Experts, UN agencies and the incident layer.</li>
	<li>The natural resources layers are based on data from IPIS, the Central African Ministry of Mines, the Central African Ministry of Hydrocarbon, USGS, the Kimberley Process, USAID’s Property Rights and Diamond Development (PRADD) project, and WRI.</li>
	<li>The forestry concessions, hunting zones and rivers layers are based on data produced and provided by the WRI.</li>
	<li>The protected areas layer has been compiled on the basis of data from the WRI, ECOFAUN, WWF and the Chinko Project.</li>
	<li>The layer on cattle migration is based on research undertaken and in consultation with experts from the FAO, FNEC and the University of Bangui.</li>
	<li>The troop location layer is based open source data published by MINUSCA and Sangaris.</li>
	<li>The arms trafficking layer is based open source data published by the UN Panel of Experts in its final report (S/2017/1023) of 2017.</li>
	<li>The airstrips layer is based open source data published by the WFP/Logistics cluster in 2017.</li>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
Given the difficulty of gathering precise and accurate geographic and thematic data, these maps will inevitably contain some inaccuracies, and are not comprehensive. <b>All maps on this interactive web map are therefore to be considered indicative only, representing a limited, rather than an exact or exhaustive overview of the geographic and thematic features depicted. </b>Indeed, as incidents shown cannot be considered exhaustive they are not necessarily suited for statistical analysis. A similar caveat applies to the summary statistics of reported fatalities presented in the histogram at the base of the map – whilst indicative these statistics cannot be considered comprehensive.
